# PokemonTeamBuilder
The program is a program to allow a user to create and customize a team of 6 Pokemon. For each, the user can specify the specie, the moves it will know, the item it will be holding, and the nature it will have.

The program reads in the Excel Document "Pokemon Data.xlsx". This document holds the data for every single Pokemon, ability, move, nature, and item, stored on separate sheets. The first sheet holds every Pokemon species available to pick from, listing their type(s), stats, and potential abilites; each Pokemon also has a "Form" variable, which indicates if the Pokemon is a transformation and what induces it. The second sheet lists and describes every ability that exists in the Pokemon database. The third sheet holds the data for every move that exists for Pokemon, including their power, their category (whether it is physical, special, or a status move), its accuracy, its power points, as well as a description of the attack. The fourth sheet holds every nature available to a Pokemon as well as what stats it will effect; a Pokemon's nature will increase one of its stat values and decrease another. The fifth sheet holds a list of every item available for a Pokemon to hold.
